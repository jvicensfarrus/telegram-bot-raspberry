# telegram-bot-raspberry
Simple program made in python that will make the raspberry do certain functionalities upon command.

The functionalities at the moment are two:

## Capture a photo
This command will capture a photo from the camera module in the raspberry. Will capture two photos, one brighter and the other more darker and send them to your telegram conversation with the bot.


## Check the temperature and humidity
This command will check the temperature and humidity through the sensor module installed in the raspberry(in my case, DHT22 sensor) and again, send them to your telegram coversation with the bot.
